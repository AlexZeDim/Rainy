# Rainy

Rainy is a small discord bot, that handles only one problem, it renames every user on join event, removing from nickname all:

 - special characters
 - spaces
 - diacritic symbols
 - numbers
 
If username has been trimmed to empty space, then bot rename user to *Recruit*.
 
Bot is named after `Rainon` and his [**Sanctum of Light**](https://discord.gg/yAhvHbM) discord community for paladin players in World of Warcraft.

## Permissions

Rainy need `rename user` permissions and the most top role above all others. It doesn't need admin or any other special permissions. But anyway, since the code is open-sourced you could give to the bot any permissions and it won't abuse it.
If bot doesn't rename the user, well, mainly because lack of permissions.
